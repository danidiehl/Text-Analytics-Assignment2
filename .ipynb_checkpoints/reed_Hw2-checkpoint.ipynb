    "# Text Analytics Group Assignment2\n",
    "Due: September 25, 2017, by 11:59 p.m. In this assignment you are an analytics consultant to a   (i) brand manager, (ii) product manager and (iii)advertising manager. Your job is    to give advice/insights to these individuals based on the analysis of social media conversations. The detailed tasks are described below. We use cars as an example of a “high involvement” good (recall from class discussions that for high involvement goods, people use social media heavily for awareness building and research).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Develop a   crawler/scraper to fetch messages posted in Edmunds.com discussion forums. The crawler output should be a .csv file with the following columns: date, userid, and message (even though you will only use the messages in your analysis). Before you develop the crawler, carefully study one of the forums on Edmunds.com to understand the html as well as the threading structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Fetch between 5,000 and 10,000 posts about cars from a General topics forum. Do NOT choosea forum dedicated to a   particular brand or model. Instead, you can choose the General & Sedans categories and then select, for example, the Entry Level Luxury forum https://forums.edmunds.com/discussion/2864/general/x/entry-level-luxury-performance-sedansThe idea is    to have multiple brands and models being discussed without one of them being the focal point.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Once you fetch the data, find the top 10 brands from frequency counts. You will need to write a script to count the frequencies. Be sure not to count a mention more than once per post, evenif   it    is mentioned multiple times.Replace modelswith brands so that from now on you have to deal with only brands and not models. You will need another script for this job. This step is meant to help simplify the analysis. A    list of model and brand names (not exhaustive) are provided in a separate file."

Show the brands on a   multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) map (use a Python script for MDS, there are multiple scripts available onthe Internet). "

       "u'i personally think that with a few tweaks the c320 could also sit at the top of this group. it\\'s still more of a entry-level luxury sedan than mercedes benz would lead you to believe. the c320 \"sport\" needs to have it\\'s suspension retuned to accept 17 inch tires without a harsh ride. mb also needs to stop forcing metal trim and black leather on everyone that wants the sport package. the c240\\'s 6-speed wouldn\\'t hurt either if offered on the c320, though it needs to be \"fixed\" first. that said, my favorite of the group is (gasp!) the new audi 3.0. the audi easily has the best interior of any sub-40k car, combine that with stunning looks and a body that is as rigid as any ever made and you have my personal favorite. the single thing i don\\'t like about the audi is the grey trim around the bottom of the car. this trim doesn\\'t match any of the body colors, as it should be body color anyway. this is an excellent car and in my opinion the best there is under 40k. the upcoming audi convertible, coupe and s4 will all be winners. the bmw 330i is now an old favorite, but i\\'m (of all people) starting to tire of the bmw just a bit, save the bmw variants. i was kind of dissappointed by the 2002 facelift, they could have done a little more in the way of styling. i hope they do a little more for 2003 with the coupe models. the acura tl-s is easily my favorite fwd car in this class. wonderful engine (you actually can hear it) and decent handling for a front driver. nice price, seat and what not, not hard to see why the tl is so popular. this car\\'s main faults are styling and obvious cost-cutting in the interior, stereo, fake wood etc. otherwise a standout. lexus es300. nice, but not my type of car at all. this is one for the buick set. the is300 is half baked, but has a wonderful chassis. styling is also in question here, it simply doesn\\'t look like a 35k car (grown). the interior is gawd-awful. bet on the next is300 being done right from the start. in their defense toyota didn\\'t initially intend for this car to be sold in the u.s. so it was a rush job. the cts holds the greatest unrealized potential here. i\\'ve seen several now, and each time i see one they look better and better. again like the c320, is300 the car has interior issues. the dash feels like it was made by rubbermaid. if you\\'re going to be stingy with wood trim, why bother? half of the steering wheel in wood, and very little anywhere else in the car??? the seat are very good though, as is the handling. a work in progress. the g35 looks like it may have a winning chassis, but the interior, though clean looking seems to be styled about 10 years ago, lots of square shapes and flat surfaces. another great engine, waiting to drive this one.don\\'t really care much for the x-type. if i were a jaguar man i\\'d be truly pissed at ford and jaguar for this one. they are actually selling a fwd x-type in england and i\\'ve read where they\\'re thinking about selling it here! hell no. the car should have been rwd not awd. some will tell you that this was done to compete with audi. thats bs, awd was the only way to keep the car from being fwd, without spending the money to convert the car to rwd. it is a good looking car though and that jaguar \"leaper\" will be enough for some, but this car has to grow on me. the chrysler chrysler is about as close to an audi that american car come. this new chrysler \"special\" is truly a good looking car inside and out. one problem: where is the performance???? a 255hp car *in this class) with a 0-60 time over 8 seconds is not accpetable. something is not right here. some say engine, transmission and/or gearing, but whatever it is, chrysler needs to let some mb engineers have a look at this car. the heavier e320 with less power is faster. i still like this car, but it\\'s no lust object once you get past the great styling. m'"
