0,"March 23, 2002  7:04PM",cybersol,"Entry level performance luxury sedans are a hot area for car manufacturers and enthusiasts alike.  These sedans show their performance by being fun to drive and handling well.  They show luxury by offering leather and some of the important creatures comforts found in the most luxurious upscale sedans. The selection of vehicles that compete in the space is vast and varied.The benchmarks which define this are the BMW 330 and the Audi A4 3.0.  But there are many contenders, such as Acura TL-S, Chrysler 300M, Jaguar X-type, Infiniti I35, Mercedes C-Class, Volvo S60 T5.  Some companies have contenders that emphasize performance Lexus IS300 or luxury Lexus ES300.  And the field is continously growing, with the recent additions being the Cadillac CTS and Infiniti G35.The common charateristics of this entry level perfomance luxury group seem to a price around 30 to 40k (US dollars) and 0-60 times between six and eight seconds.With this wide variety of cars targeted at a similar market segment, the choices for our own personal car are great.  But with all these choices, it is hard to understand and personally evaluate all these options.  So this topic has been created to start a discussion on the relative merits and personalities of the cars available in this entry level performance luxury field."
1,"March 25, 2002  5:54AM",merc1,"I personally think that with a few tweaks the C320 could also sit at the top of this group.  It's still more of a entry-level luxury sedan than Mercedes would lead you to believe.   The C320 ""Sport"" needs to have it's suspension retuned to accept 17 inch tires without a harsh ride.  MB also needs to stop forcing metal trim and black leather on everyone that wants the sport package.  The C240's 6-speed wouldn't hurt either if offered on the C320, though it needs to be ""fixed"" first. That said, my favorite of the group is (gasp!) the new A4 3.0.   The A4 easily has the best interior of any sub-40K car, combine that with stunning looks and a body that is as rigid as any ever made and you have my personal favorite.   The single thing I don't like about the A4 is the grey trim around the bottom of the car.  This trim doesn't match any of the body colors, as it should be body color anyway.   This is an excellent car and in my opinion the best there is under 40K.  The upcoming A4 Convertible, Coupe and S4 WILL all be winners. The BMW 330i is now an old favorite, but I'm (of all people) starting to tire of the 3-Series just a bit, save the M3 variants.   I was kind of dissappointed by the 2002 facelift, they could have done a little more in the way of styling.  I hope they do a little more for 2003 with the coupe models. The Acura TL-S is easily my favorite fwd car in this class.  Wonderful engine (you actually can hear it) and decent handling for a front driver.  Nice price, seats and what not, not hard to see why the TL is so popular.  This car's main faults are styling and obvious cost-cutting in the interior, stereo, fake wood etc.  Otherwise a standout. Lexus ES300.  Nice, but not my type of car at all.  This is one for the Buick set.  The IS300 is half baked, but has a wonderful chassis.  Styling is also in question here, it simply doesn't look like a 35K car (grown).  The interior is gawd-awful.  Bet on the next IS300 being done right from the start.  In their defense Toyota didn't initially intend for this car to be sold in the U.S. so it was a rush job. The CTS holds the greatest unrealized potential here.  I've seen several now, and each time I see one they look better and better.  Again like the C320, IS300 the car has interior issues.  The dash feels like it was made by Rubbermaid.  If you're going to be stingy with wood trim, why bother?  Half of the steering wheel in wood, and very little anywhere else in the car???  The seats are very good though, as is the handling.  A work in progress. The G35 looks like it may have a winning chassis, but the interior, though clean looking seems to be styled about 10 years ago, lots of square shapes and flat surfaces.  Another great engine, waiting to drive this one.Don't really care much for the X-Type.  If I were a Jaguar man I'd be truly pissed at Ford and Jaguar for this one.  They are actually selling a fwd X-Type in England and I've read where they're thinking about selling it here!  Hell no.  The car should have been rwd not awd.  Some will tell you that this was done to compete with Audi.  Thats BS, awd was the only way to keep the car from being fwd, WITHOUT spending the money to convert the car to rwd.  It is a good looking car though and that Jaguar ""leaper"" will be enough for some, but this car has to grow on me. The Chrysler 300M is about as close to an Audi that American cars come.  This new 300M ""Special"" is truly a good looking car inside and out.  One problem: Where is the performance????  A 255hp car *in this class) with a 0-60 time over 8 seconds is not accpetable.  Something is not right here.  Some say engine, transmission and/or gearing, but whatever it is, Chrysler needs to let some MB engineers have a look at this car.  The heavier E320 with less power is faster.   I still like this car, but it's no lust object once you get past the great styling.  M"
2,"March 25, 2002  7:06AM",fredvh,I am debating a new purchase and these two are at the top of my list. The price difference between these two is approx. 6K (non-Type S Acura). Is the ES300 worth 6K over the TL? I don't know because I have never owned a TL but I am familiar with the ES300(previous generation). Supposedly the 2002 ES300 is a lot better than the previous generation but is it that much better than the TL? Of great importance to me is initial quality and overall dependability. Does the TL compare with the ES300 in both of these categorys? I am not familiar with the Honda Co. Are prices lower than Lexus for service work? I would appreciate any input on this dilemma from some TL owners.
3,"March 25, 2002  5:02PM",blueguydotcom,"Great handling, RWD, excellent engine and the best warranty around.  Easy winner."
4,"March 25, 2002 11:04PM",hungrywhale,"And no manual tranny.  That may not matter to you, but it most certainly does matter to me and many other enthusiast drivers.So IMO, it's not even on the board, let alone the 'easy winner'."
5,"March 26, 2002 12:44AM",riez,"One beauty of BMW 3 Series is that there are so many models to choose from.  Almost half of all buyers in America don't get the basic RWD 4 door sedan.  Besides having 3 engine and 3 transmission choices, you can get coupe, convertible, AWD, station wagon, and super-high performance M-Series!!!hungrywhale...  I concur that having the availability of a manual transmission across the line is absolutely critical!!!"
6,"March 26, 2002  8:20PM",blueguydotcom,"good grief, so you wait 9 months for the manual.  Even with an auto, I prefer to every car listed and I NEVER have owned an auto and never thought I'd enjoy driving a car with an auto.  That's what value, performance and an exceptional engine can do for a car.  Once the G has a stick there is not another sedan under the M3 that I'd consider."
7,"March 26, 2002  9:02PM",hungrywhale,"I'll give it a fair shot when the manual comes out, but I'm just flat-out not interested in an auto.  I don't care how fast it is.  It's not about the speed, it's about the driving experience and having more control over the car."
8,"March 26, 2002  9:45PM",blueguydotcom,"I understand it's not about the speed.  I really don't care if the car won't do over 100 as I rarely break the century mark.  What I do care about is power and with the manual mode on the auto, I can get it when I want it.  Will I buy an auto-equipped G?  In all likelihood, no.  I desperately want to drive the 6 speed."
9,"March 27, 2002 12:00AM",hungrywhale,It sounds like you know why I won't even put it on my list (let alone at the top) until the manual comes out.
10,"March 27, 2002  2:00AM",riez,"Is there such a thing as an automatic-only true performance sedan?  Not in my book.  Certainly not in Europe or Asia.  Only in America is such an oxymoron possible.  Sad.If or when the manual G35 comes out and the coupe version, then the G35 will be interesting enough to be a serious contender in this segment."
11,"March 27, 2002  2:55AM",wishnhigh1,"If I had to rank the entry lux performance sedans, here is what I would choose:Audi A4 3.0(lots of bang for the buck, loads of style and loads of luxury)Cadillac CTS( Decent BTFB, good handling, non-lemming style)Infinity G35(Tons of BFTB, good luxury, but completely boring exterior and even more boring of an interior)BMW 325(very little BFTB, excellent handling/build quality/resale, classy looking but too conservative for me)SAAB Viggen(almost zero BFTB, spotty build quality, but the damn coolest style in the world).

But I think you are wrong to not consider a car such as a Infiniti G35 to be a serious contender as a performance luxury sedan.  From your logic, then the BMW 3-series (your wife's) or the 5-series with the Steptronic should not be contenders either. That's belittling the Infiniti, Audi, Lexus, Acuras, BMW's etc. with automatics. When I return in December from Qatar, I plan on purchasing a sports sedan. I'm leaning on the G35, but the BMW 330i along with the Audi S4 are also contenders. IMO, if the handling of the Infiniti is as good as the BMW as some that drove it has stated, then it will hard to pass up especially for the price. Also my first choice will be a manual, and Infiniti should have the manual out by December. I will test drive all three, manual and automatics, and make my choice from there. I do agree with you that manuals are more fun to drive, and that will be my first choice. But, automatics in this category, especially those made by BMW, Infiniti and others, should not be eliminated as performance sedans. Different flavors for different people.I have been following discussions on many boards and what I have been noticing is that there is so many ""experts"" on what is the best sports sedan. And most haven't even driven the competitors to give an honest opinion. This is not aimed at you Riez or Shipko, because your profiles states that you own a BMW already. But from what I noticed is that some BMW ""supportors"" don't even own a BMW, (at least not from their profile) or they state that they never drove an Infiniti G35, but they still make ""unsupported"" facts, assumptions or opinions on such. (See the Edmund's BMW 3-series discussion).  I hope in your defense, Reiz, that you drove the automatic Infiniti G35, to give an opinionated statement that it doesn't classify as a performance sedan. I value your opinion and others as well.Again, I'm not flaming you, but I try to be an informed consumer before I buy anything. That is the reason that I will drive every car that I'm interested in and make my choice from there. I'm also always interested in those opinions from people that own the type of car I'm shopping for and at least drove it, so they can give valid pro/negative statements.Cheers!"
14,"March 27, 2002  5:00PM",hungrywhale,"I think what riez and I are trying to say is not that automatics perform poorly or that only weenies drive them But any car that truly holds itself out as a performance sedan NEEDS at least the option of a manual tranny.  Manuals are always faster than automatics and they are almost always the choice of the enthusiast driver.There's nothing at all wrong with automatics, but I sure don't want one."

16,"March 27, 2002  6:23PM",dave330i,"In this class, the best bang for the buck has to be IS300, assuming one can live with the styling. I guess I'm one of the few that likes the old A4 styling to the new. Isn't the new A4 pushing 3600 lbs. now? That's pretty heavy for this class."
17,"March 27, 2002  7:06PM",blueguydotcom,"Even at 29k for a 35k msrp IS300, I passed on it.  Now I never drove a manual one (they weren't out yet) but even with a manual, given the car's horrible drive-feel, poor interior and lethargic steering, I don't think I'd go near one.  They're not up to Audi/BMW/MB/Infiniti."
18,"March 27, 2002  8:42PM",wishnhigh1,"Never liked a lexus, and probably never will. I would rather drive the CTS. There is always something that irritates me about them. I would buy the IS as a Toyota but not a Lexus...I personally think Lexus should have a car in its lineup with this cheap of an interior and with this much sporting character. Toyota deserves something like it though. Also, I don't think 215 horsepower for 29k is a lot of bang for the buck, considering the G35 is the same price with 260 horsies."
19,"March 27, 2002  8:46PM",dave330i,"""I would buy the IS as a Toyota but not a Lexus""How else are they going to get that extra $5k from you then? Reasonably equipped G35 goes for $33k or so."
20,"March 27, 2002  9:10PM",riez,"I couldn't have said it better myself.  I'll let you lead services!  mbarto...  I most certainly will test a G35 manual if and when it finally comes out.  I promise!!!  Automatics make nice luxury sedans and maybe even sporty luxury sedans.  But NOT performance sedans or luxury performance sedans.  (I don't even consider the 540iA Sport truly worthy, though it is as close as one can get in an automatic.  If I could just get my wife to drive a manual....)"
21,"March 28, 2002  7:43AM",mbarto,"Thanks Riez! Let me know when you do.  I'm sure you'll get a chance before I will since I won't return until December. I am curious of how it compares to the BMW's. YOU can speak from experience, so I'll value your opinion.It does make a difference being married. (LOL!  see the latest discussions on the Infiniti G35 vs BMW 330i board).  First, I'm fortunate to have a wife that can drive a manual. Not that she prefers that, her first choice is an automatic.  But she appreciates the hard work and sacrifice I'm doing out here, and knows that this car is for me first, family second. Of course, it helps my cause when I let her buy a new dining room set last month, and new living room drapes this month. Bribes do help! Whatever I finally decide, I'm sure she'll be happy."
22,"March 29, 2002 12:07AM",riez,"mbarto... As regards the ""bribes"" issue, you've figured out one of life's great truism:  You get what you want so I can get what I want."""
23,"April  5, 2002 10:34PM",cybersol,"So if someone were looking to purchase a new performance luxury sedan today, what cars would they HAVE to take a look at and test drive?  Lets say they only had time to look at five?What five would they have to look into?"
24,"April  6, 2002 12:16AM",riez,"Since it has to have a manual transmission and should be RWD (AWD/4WD adds too much weight and complexity) and has to be fun to drive hard...1.  BMW 3 Series manual2.  Lexus IS300 manual3.  Cadillac CTS manual4.  Lincoln LS6 manualIf you want affordable and can go FWD, then add Nissan Maxima 6-speed with LSD and maybe Altima 3.5SE 5-speed.Try to get car with LSD.  Inline 6s are magnificently smooth engines.Possible future car:  Infiniti G35 sedan when it finally gets the 6-speed manual."
25,"April  7, 2002  3:22PM",coolguyky7,"The TL should be up for redesign in a few years so a TL would be outdated in the not so far future.  And besides, it seems like everyone who drives an Acura drives the TL.  I LOVE the ES300.  Some say it looks bloated; I don't think it does.  At the 3/4 angle, it looks impressive.  The interior is as nice as a car can get.  If I had the money, I would buy an ES300 in a heartbeat.  I never did like the past ones' boring styling...especially since the last two generations were nearly twins.  Go with the ES.  Besides, Lexus' quality is ahead of Acura's."
26,"April  7, 2002 10:59PM",kdshapiro,"The new ES is a very smart looking car. Notwithstanding any engine issues though, I think there are direct price competitors like the I35 that offer better overall value on paper. Now I haven't driven either new model, I did drive the older ES300 and it did it's job very well. They are both great cars. Lexus for legendary reliability and resale value, Infiniti for up-to-date features."
27,"April  8, 2002 10:32PM",blueguydotcom,"Um...you left off the Infiniti G35 and it's bland, boring brother the I35 (the ES300's competition).29k gets someone a 4 door 260 HP performance entry level luxury sedan with all sorts of goodies."
28,"April  9, 2002  9:12PM",jagboyxkr,"Sorry, I thought that I had already taken up too much space, and I also was getting tired of typing.  When I check out an Infiniti G35, maybe I'll post something on it.I always thought the I35's looked all right, even if they aren't the most exciting cars ever built."
29,"April  9, 2002  9:43PM",blueguydotcom,"Go drive one.  They're a blast and for the money they're a steal.  If someone wants entry level performance luxury at a great price, the G's really tough to beat.  Save for BMW, it sort of stands head and shoulders over most of its competition."
30,"April 12, 2002  2:53PM",merc1,"Well I'm a Benz fan first and foremost, but the A4 3.0 CVT just offers more for the money.  The A4 has a better interior, the top A4 engine (compared to the C240, which is the base C) and it's styling is at least as good as the Benz if not better.   Both makes pay for scheduled maint during the warranty period.    Neither car will be ""low maintanence"" after the warranty runs out, especially the Audi with it's fairly different transmission.   If you're priced these cars and they've come out equal go for the Audi it's the better value here. M"
31,"April 14, 2002  8:09AM",popovs,"I think both are excellent(sp?) cars, however neither one is a low maintenance automobile. That is to say neither brand is known for low maintenance.  What they do offer is luxury and performance in an aesthetically pleasing package and, some would argue, a superior ownership experience.As someone has said before, every manifacturer makes lemons - some more than others - but the internet is not the best place to find information about that.  Most people are just venting and are not representative of the owner community.  Although I can not speak as to the driving merits of the cars, I suspect that they are similar since I've heard (read) good things about both the A4 CVT and the C240.  Something to keep in mind is that anytime a new product is offered by the industry, it usually takes a couple of years for the company to work out all the bugs in the technology.  Both cars are relative newcommers to the market.  The facts that they are made by distinguished companies and use proven powerplants does not speak conclusively as to how reliable the cars will be as a whole.Since you are already looking for alternatives to the MB because of reliability concerns, it may be worth your time to look at other alternatives than the Audi.  As someone has suggested in the Help me Choose! forum, try looking to Lexus for the answer.  They seem to make reliable cars that are also cheap to keep running.  Of course now we get into the issue of European vs Asian luxury ..."
32,"April 17, 2002  9:23AM",popovs,"It has come to my attention that as of late MB has taken a hit in its reputation.  People have been quick to point at the recent survey results - both European and Domestic - that say Mercedes is no longer reliable.  These surveys show that statistically speaking MB has as much as doubled the amount of repairs that they do under warranty.  I won't deny these findings, but I will try and justify them.  1st and foremost, MB has and is comming out with newer designs every year, updating the cars both inside and out.  Anytime that a new product makes its debue it takes a couple of tries to get all the kinks worked out.  Secondly, according to mbspy.com, Mercedes accounted for ~half of the profits by DCX last year.  I think MB is being used as a cash cow to keep Jeep and Co affloat, thereby driving Mercedes to cost-cutting through corparate pressure.  Lower quality parts equal lower overall car quality.These two should get things going ... Feel free to agree or disagree."
33,"April 17, 2002  7:37PM",mvargo1,"There is not much to debate on this subject.  If you want a reliable car you buy Japanese.  If you want a drivers car you used to have to buy european.  The Japanese just do quality better and more consistantly than anyone else.  You also get a lot more car for your money with a Japanese vehicle.  There was a time when the europeans built the best driving cars in the world.  Sadly for them those days are passing.  The Japanese keep building cars that are closer and closer to european driving dynamics (IS and GS series Lexus(Lexi?), and Q45 and G35 Infiniti's)  While the europeans quality especially Daimler/Chrysler just is not keeping up."

35,"April 18, 2002 11:12PM",cybersol,"I'm interested more towards performance than luxury.  Also value is an important component for me.  Although I have the money to buy these cars, I also have other fun things and places to spend it.  I'm looking to buy the car and keep it for around 7-10 years.  Its very sunny with no snow here as well.  I also want an automatic or CVT(gasp).So right now, the five I am going to look at more closely are as follows:1) BMW 330i2) Audi A4 3.0 CVT3) Infiniti G354) Acura TL-S5) Nissan Altima 3.5 SEThe BMW represents the top of the class, but it also has the highest price.  The Altima represents the most performance oriented family car, which is a cheaper class of cars.  The BMW and Altima will bracket the value equation.  The other three all have the potential to compete for my dollars.Cars that are missing, IS300 too small, while the styling of the CTS, S60 T5, and 9-5 Aero are not for me.  The ES300 and I35 don't have enough performance for me.  Everything more expensive than a comparibly equipped 330i was also excluded.What do you guys think? Anything missing?Thanks,cybersol"
36,"April 18, 2002 11:50PM",riez,"cybersol...  I can't fathom why you would want to go with slushbox, but that is your loss.Comparing FWD to RWD is like apples to oranges.Not sure what sort of real price range you are looking at.  The 330i with options might push $40,000.  You might really consider the much less expensive 325i.  An Altima 3.5SE with few options might have a $25,000 MSRP.Read Motor Trend's review of I35.  Their's had more than enough performance.  0-60 mph in 7.0 seconds, fastest in their comparison test.  And it can be had with a Sport Package.  But you might be better off with a loaded Maxima SE or GLE, saving thousands off the I35.You might also consider Volkwagen Passat.  That can also be had with AWD.  If you like AWD, the Jag X-type should be on your list.From the domestic corner, you might also consider a Lincoln LS 6 or 8.  Or Chrysler 300M.Surprised your list excludes the Mercedes-Benz C-class. And if you can live with a FWD automatic, a loaded Camry or Accord V-6 or Avalon might be acceptable near the Altima's price range."
37,"April 19, 2002  1:07AM",cybersol,"Sorry to disappoint with the slushbox, but if we were all the same life would be boring (and there would only be 1 car type). I would prefer RWD, but the best FWD's (torque sensitive steering) are getting close enough to bring the acceptable price premium for RWD down. Price range is 25-40K as you mention.Passat, 300M, 325i, are too slow for me.  The C Classes are either too slow or more expensive than the BMW.  I would choose the BMW over the X-type, as they are similarly priced and I live in sun country.The maxima (better value than the I35) is a good suggestion, and I am considering that equally with the Altima at the lower end.My wife loves Camry's, but I'm looking for excitement.  slushbox or not.Thanks,cybersol"
38,"April 19, 2002  2:14AM",kdshapiro,"The new Altima is great as my friends just bought one. However, dollar for dollar I think the Maxima is the over-all winner for a FWD car. If you can live without the amenities of the I35 the GLE with leather, sunroof, BOSE can't be beat. I've owned two Maximas. Me! I recently made the jump to the 330i, and it's been worth every penny. However the G35 owners are very passionate about their choices. For a couple of dollars more than the Maxima, hovering around the I35 I guess, the TL-S can't be beat either.I understand when it comes down to it, you pick what you think has the right combination of value, performance, luxury and the right type of car for you. For every person it is different. When I got the BMW I was cross-shopping SUVs, mini-vans, and FWD passenger cars to see what struck my fancy, and I was ready to get an Explorer."
39,"April 19, 2002  2:18AM",riez,"cybersol... Excitement and slushbox don't seem to be compatible.  I can't get too excited about FWDers.  Certainly not a slushbox FWDer.Not sure what you mean about ""the best FWDers (torque sensitive steering)"".Very powerful FWDers tend to suffer from severe torque steering.  Use of equal length half-shafts and limited slip differential can help, but not completely eliminate.  The laws of physics remain.  When the drive wheels and steering wheels are one and the same, and you have a powerful motor, you'll get some torque steering.Do you have kids?  Plan to in near future?  If not, have you considered any coupes or convertibles?  They can be a bit more exciting."
40,"April 19, 2002  3:28PM",dave330i,"""Excitement and slushbox don't seem to be compatible.""Agreed. Unfortunately, most American drivers don't seem to get it. They care about silly stuff like 0-60, 1/4 mile, hp & torque numbers, but choose to miss out on the fun part of driving."
41,"April 20, 2002  8:18AM",cybersol,"Riez, you have heard of speed sensitive steering?  This varies the power steering boost as with the speed.  Acura claims to have torque sensitive power steering on the TL-S (not the TL though).  This would supposedly vary the power steering boost with the torque being applied.  And that in theory could eliminate a large amount of torque steer found in powerful FWD cars.  It still doesn't eliminate the FWD tendency to under steer due the the drive wheels being the same as the turning wheels."
42,"April 20, 2002  4:49PM",riez,"cybersol...  There are two types.  Those tied to engine output and those tied to road speed.  I have heard that the latter are superior, since you can vary engine speeds (RPMs) a lot, depending upon gear being used and speed, even while driving relative steady speeds.  Better systems vary boost on road speed, since you normally need more assist at low speeds, regardless of engine RPMs.Here is all that the lengthy full-color TL brochure says:  ""Steering: Variable Power-Assist Rack-and-Pinion"".  This is off the tech specs on page 30.  I cannot find a single mention of the steering system anywhere else in the brochure.  So if Acura thinks its variable assist power steering system is special, they are keeping it a secret.  This large brochure covers both the TL and TL Type S."
43,"April 21, 2002  7:36AM",cybersol,"Yeah, I have that brouchure and they don't mention the difference between the TL and TL-S, though they say both have variable power assist.  They do not say how it varies.
But on the Acura website.  TL -> Specifications -> Body/Suspension/Chassis it says:Steering Type TL Type S - Torque-sensitive, variable power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering 3.2TL - Speed-sensitive, variable power-assisted rack-and-pinion steeringHere's the link if you want to check it out:http://www.acura.com/model_TL/tl_spec_results.aspHard to find, but not a secret."
44,"April 21, 2002  1:50PM",riez,"cybersol...  From what I've read, the better variable power assist system is tied to road speed, not engine RPMs.  Once you get a car up to 25 mph or more, there isn't much need for assist, even if your RPMs decline due to turning or downshifting.  And certainly once you hit 45 mph or more there isn't much need for assist no matter what happens to your RPMs.But keep in mind that torque steering isn't due to the steering system.  It is due to other factors.  Can be very pronounced in powerful FWDers.  Corrective actions include limited slip differentials and equal half-shafts.  Need to provide equal power simultaneously to drive wheels.From standing start, floor your car.  See if the wheel pulls in one direction.  You'll have to correct with the steering wheel (to keep the car straight) but by then you'll have already encountered the torque steering.  You can also notice it if you are aggressively accelerating in a curve.  Wheels pull you out of your intended direction and you have to correct."
45,"April 24, 2002  2:51PM",beartrax79,"So, if you read through most of this group, alot of references went out to Audi... give a guy a hand here and compare an Audi A4 3.0 to an Audi S4... I see a difference of about $5K, 30hp, and a sporty suspension.  Why shouldn't I load up a 3.0, rather than going after the S4?Oh, and does anyone know on possible improvements for one or the other for 2003?"
46,"April 25, 2002 12:15AM",cybersol,"Have you driven them both?  The S4 really moves.  Even by Audi's own 0-60 times the S4 manual is 1 second faster and the S4 tiptronic is 1.2 seconds faster.  Yet, the S4 is currently based on the 2001 A4 platform, and it is scheduled to be upgraded to the new platform in the 2003 model year.  Expect the performance difference to increase as the indications are that the new S4 will pack 300 or more hp.Hope this helps."

48,"April 26, 2002  4:50PM",cybersol,"Yeah, the current S4 has 250 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque.  The torque is fully online by 1850 rpm.  So this is why it scoots.  The new S4 should be really nice.  If you have the time to wait, it might be worth seeing.  It might move up in price a little if the performance gets closer to the BMW M3, but then the old S4's should be easier to pick up at a good price right as the new ones are coming out.

49,"April 27, 2002  9:37PM",1pierce,"Not so fast.  There is merit to the ""nationality based"" debate.  Let me explain to you why Japanese cars have higher quality (in terms of reliability) than American or European cars.  The reason is cultural.Americans have always had an adventurous, entrepreneurial spirit.  We take chances.  Its not in our nature to ""accept"" things as they are.  I think this is somewhat genetic, since the vast number of us are descended from immigrants - aren't we all, really - people who took tremendous risk, and had great courage to brave the unknown for the promise of a new and better life.  As such, in areas of design, we bore very easily.  Americans are always looking for the next great thing, the next new design, the next technology breakthrough.  Europeans, especially Germans, are like this about cars, if not about everything else.  The US auto industry is always ready to chuck the old and start over from scratch - witness Chrysler and Ford over the last two decades.  As such, our products are usually stylish and inventive, but not very refined - see minivans, SUV's, cab-forward, night-vision, etc..The Japanese by comparison have a culture that is traditional and thousands of years old.  They have made an entire culture out of honoring tradition and the status quo.  We had to yank them kicking and screaming into the 20th century after world war II.  I know this is somewhat simplistic, but bear with me.  What the Japanese are good at is taking an idea and refining it year after year, until it is near perfect.  There is very little innovation or risk taking.  That is why the cars are so bland.  When was the last time you saw a new technology invented in Japan?  VCR's, computer technology, cell phones, the microwave oven...all American inventions that are better built by the Japanese.  The same goes for cars.  Most innovations come from the US or Germany, with some safety innovations coming from Scandinavia (give up the turbos and 5-cylinders, already those are as refined as they're going to get!).Anyway,...when you distill it down to its essence, this is why Toyotas and Hondas never break.  Its also why they are no more than transportation appliances.  And, this is why the best performance cars from Japan will always be knock-offs (albeit sometimes very good ones) of something somebody else does better and more originally.I'll step off my soap box now, and await your wailing."
50,"April 27, 2002  9:54PM",wishnhigh1,"The problem is that they are HUGE generalizations. Also, you are talking Japanese as almost exclusivly Honda and Toyota. What about Subaru, Mazda, Isuzu, Mitsubishi, Daihatsu, and Suzuki? So far the only makes that seem to keep with that Japanese Culture are Toyota and Honda. And many American and European makes are now capable of having higher quality than more than 70% of Japanese cars. Doesn't help your generalization that much, does it?So where do the generalizations stop? They should stop with brands, and not nations."
51,"April 28, 2002  2:38AM",kd6aw1,"Have found out that with some of the more powerful cars like the G35 or Corvette the difference in performance from a practical standpoint isn't really an issue because these cars are faster than we can ever dream of driving without either killing ourselves or getting tickets all the time.

58,"May 28, 2002  2:50PM",rayainsw,"I beg to differ.While I admit that I am biased (obviously, since I bought one!) I believe that the W8 is really a performance sedan.I test drove the G35, and several BMWs (and a few others) before making my final choice.  I suppose the term &#145;performance sedan&#146; could be defined in any number of ways.  For me, the W8 offers everything I want &#150; and nothing I don&#146;t.(Isn&#146;t that a recent Nissan &#145;tag line&#146;?)Take straight line acceleration, for instance.  VW literature quotes 0 &#150; 60 in 6.5 sec.  To me, this is pretty quick for a 4 door sedan.  My fearless (?) prediction of future test acceleration numbers is:  0 &#150; 60 in 6.5 sec., as VW claims.  And a quarter mile in about 15.0 at 94 / 95.  I base this on a number of things.  For instance, in the May 2000 Car and Driver comparison that included the Lincoln LS8 Sport and the Audi A6 2.7TT, the Audi tested had virtually identical curb weight as the W8, identical final drive, wheel / tire size and Tiptronic.  The HP / TQ for this Audi were 250 / 258.  And their test results were: 0 &#150; 60 in 6.6 sec. and the quarter mile in 15.1 at 94.  Thus, my W8 with 270 / 273 ought to do slightly better.  We&#146;ll see. . .  (BTW: in the same test, the Lincoln LS8 Sport they tested turned in acceleration numbers of: 0 &#150; 60 in 7.5 and the quarter mile in 15.7 at 90.  This was my previous car.  So, it seems reasonable that my W8 feels quicker &#150; setting aside the notorious un-reliability of everyone&#146;s &#145;butt dyno&#146;!)Does it pull the same lateral G as the G35 or a BMW 3 series w/Sport Package.  Almost certainly no.  But with more aggressive rubber, I expect that it will provide enough grip for entertainment value at any sane public road speed.

The CTS i drove was a 5 speed sport model with a sticker of 38k (gasp!).  The tranny was rough, very rough, almost Mustang bad.  The interior felt cheap with lots of hard plastic and very little in the way of substantial or soft-touch materials.  The throttle response was weak and required excessive modulation of a rather awkward gas pedal.  The car's a rolling bed of 1998 technology, no automatic brake distribution for one thing.  The salesmen kept insisting 4 channel ABS is impressive...to each his own.  Handling?  Nothing at all like the claims car mags are making.

69,"June 28, 2002  4:10AM",jagboyxtype,"I came to a different conclusion about the Jaguar X-TYPE 3.0 and the Audi A4 3.0 Quattro.  I was considering both vehicles, and it was very close, but the Jaguar won for me.ACCELERATION:In acceleration times, the Jaguar is clearly faster than the Audi.  Car&Driver states of the X-TYPE, ""Subjectively, the X-TYPE didn't feel quite as quick as a BMW 330i.  But a few instrumented acceleration runs revealed that the measured 0-to-60-mph time of 6.3 seconds was only 0.2 seconds slower than the small BMW.  We would rate the smoothness of the X-TYPE's V-6 to be similarly close to that of the Bavarian in-line six.""Road&Track says of the X-TYPE's performance, ""In acceleration, the 3.0 X-TYPE is among the quickest.  Accompanied by a nice-but-distant exhaust note, the Jag goes from 0-60 mph in 6.5 seconds, undercutting the boy-racer Lexus IS 300's and Audi A4's 7.1, the Mercedes C320's 6.8 sec. and matching the BMW 330i's time.""-Jaguar X-TYPE 3.0 acceleration times: 6.3 - 6.5 sec*.-Audi A4 3.0 Quattro acceleration time: 7.1 sec*.* = manual transmission.HANDLING:Of how the cars handle, R&T says of the X-TYPE, ""Whether the chassis is redolent of Jaguar tradition or not, no one complained that it didn't work.  It feels like a modern, well-balanced sports sedan with excellent highway ride and good balance in the corners.  Every time we got into a long stretch of fast, curving mountain road, whoever was in the Jag inevitably got on the walkietalkies we all carry and said, 'This thing is really good in the curves!'  It's a confidence-inspiring car, with good grip, linear steering, and precise turn-in.  The engine is not bad either.  Our test car's optional 3.0-liter 4-cam V-6 (there's a less expensive 2.5 version as well) put out a respectable 231 bhp, keeping it in this fast company with no particular effort.""  They also say of its suspension, ""Jaguar engineers told us they wanted the suspension to be 'connected but relaxed,'and that seems to wrap it up nicely.  The ride is about as smooth as you'll find in this class, even with the Sport suspension.  Given its soft ride, the X-TYPE delivers surprisingly good handling.""Of the Audi's handling, they say, ""Dynamically, the all-wheel-drive car is not as crisp as it looks.  It handles well enough and has a superb highway ride, but it accomplishes these goals in a rather soft and rubbery style of suspension tuning and steering...In short, the Audi is missing that firm, rally-car edge and sense of steering precision that makes the BMW, for instance, so delightful to drive.  It's a car that can keep up with the other sports sedans, but doesn't feel very sporty doing it, despite our car's having the optional sport suspension for $750...We noticed in some of the whoop-de-dos and curves of our desert highway that the Audi produced 'considerable excitement,' as one driver put it, and was simply more floaty and loose than the others.  And again, 'This is where you pay for that great highway ride,' one driver noted.  The 3.0-liter 220-bhp dohc aluminum V-6 is smooth and reasonably peppy, though well back from the front of this pack.""STEERING:Motor Trend says of the X-TYPE's ZF Servotronic II variable-ratio speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion steering system, ""The car's best system may be its speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion power steering.  In fact, it matches the previously unrivaled precision served up by BMW 3 Series.  Car placement feels laser-guided precise, with excellent feedback and road feel.  With complete confidence and comfort, we drove at most times with just our fingertips - even at 120 mph on the track.  The only all-wheel-drive car we've ever driven offering similar levels of steering communication is the Nissan Skyline GT-R, a pretty racy piece.""The Audi's steering was criticized again by Car & Driver and Road & Track for being, ""rubbery"" in feeling, and C&D said that the ""steering wheel vibrates at peak engine revs.""Car&Driver also says that the steering system of the X-TYPE ""is nothing short of terrific.""  They call it ""enthusiast goods"".Forbes even takes note of the steering system in the X, ""Jaguar engineers boast it's the best steering system they've ever had on any model.  We agree.""ALL-WHEEL-DRIVE:Audi is known for its Quattro AWD system, which has been develped for over 22 years now.  Quattro IV its newest version, and is used on the A4.  It divides power 50/50 to the front and rear wheels unless slip is detected, and is known to be one of the best systems available.  Torque steer is said to be very minor, and it is said to work well with even the turbocharged 1.8-liter 4-cylinder versions of the A4, although it is noted by some to feel heavy without the larger V6.  Audi also used Quattro to prove that AWD in certain racing conditions could be better than other setups, and later was banned from using AWD cars in certain races because of its advantages.Jaguar uses a new AWD system they designed called Traction 4, which divides torque 40% to the front wheels, and 60% to the rear unless slip is detected.  This, along with specially designed roller bearings fitted between the tops of the front strut towers and the body, along with its advanced steering mechanism, give the performance and feel of a RWD car.  Unlike most AWD systems, Car&Driver said that Traction 4 produces no torque steer to interphere with the purity of the steering.Forbes stated of the X-TYPE's AWD, ""The X-TYPE gets a seemless, virtually transparent new 40/60 viscous coupling all-wheel-drive system with optional dynamic stability control that rivals Audi's vaunted Quattro for wet- and dry- weather grip.""Road&Track said that, ""...The Jag is better balanced.  It will understeer during turn-in, take something of a set, and then pull you through.  It's a safe and secure feeling that signals what's about to happen and gives you plenty of time to adjust""BRAKING:The X-TYPE features the same vented front and solid rear discs as found on the larger S-TYPE.Road & Track said, ""In braking tests, the X-TYPE had impressive and easily repeatable stopping distances from 60 mph (118 ft.) and 80 mph (208 ft.)""  In another one of their articles, they say, ""The braking distances turned by the X-TYPE are exceptional, comparable to those of top sports cars.""Car & Driver also said, ""A few laps at the Castle Combe racetrack allowed us to explore the outer reaches of the X-TYPE's handling, where it proved completely benign, thanks to the all-wheel-drive.  Even at the limit, understeer never grinds the front tires excessively, but the only way to get the tail out was to flick the steering wheel while simultaneously lifting the throttle.  The four-wheel disc brakes proved linear and powerful under repeated heavy track use.""By comparison, a BMW M-Roadster stops from 60 mph in the same 118 feet as the Jag.  The Porsche 911 GT2 stops from 60 just two feet shorter than the Jag, at 116 feet.  An SLK32 AMG does"

The Jaguar goes for the warm-looking British cabin that its family members also display, utilizing massive amounts of wood and Conolly leather with bits of chrome; the Audi has a German, functional design that is still inviting with clean lines and details.  I really like the interiors of both cars.  The Jaguar has the best leather and wood, but a few things like the plastic of the Audi's air vents seems more resilient, etc.Road&Track said that, ""Despite the lower-than-XJ price, the X-TYPE sports the traditional Jaguar upscale cabin...The simple round gauges have an easy-on-the-eyes green backing on the instrument faces, there's birds-eye maple trim scattered around the cockpit, and the seats are tasteful and comfortable...The Jag's interior is a rich assemblage of shapes and textures, done up with nice details like the silver-rimmed green-faced gauges.""  They say it ""may be an 'entry level' model, but you wouldn't know it judging by all that leather, wood, and the easy to use nav system.""Motor Trend says the X-TYPE ""has great styling inside and out"", and says specifically that the interior is ""soothing, luxurious, and reasonably sound from an ergonomic standpoint.  The main instruments are nicely detailed and easily readable through the steering wheel.  HVAC and audio-system controls are housed in a centrally mounted horseshoe-shaped binnacle, which allows lots of genuine maple veneer to span the entire dash...It's pure Jag inside and out.""Car&Driver says ""As you'd expect, the interior is lined in sumptuous Connolly leather and bird's-eye maple wood trim on the dashboard and doors.  Luxury amenities abound, as well as the expected front, side, and head airbags...The level of finish is very nice with neat stitiching, close fits, and excellent materials throughout.""_____________________________eaweg-My opinion is that the Audi and the Jaguar are both great cars, but that the Jaguar offers more.  It is more expensive than the A4, but it is more expensive for a reason.  It is known to outhandle the A4 and outperform it in acceleration and braking, and it has the most rigid chassis in its class, 30% more than the previous class leader.  AWD is also standard, as well as Connolly leather and wood.  You must have had a bad test car if yours felt like it was going to fall apart, because everything I have read and experienced with the X-TYPE says that it is very solid with high-quality materials throughout.  Like you said, to each their own."

72,"June 28, 2002  1:02PM",eaweg,"Thanks for the response...I too have read all of the magazines...I love automobile literature! At the sametime I have come to realize how much biased opinion there is (and maybe payoffs?   )Anyhow, I would agree with you that so far all of the statistics that have come back point to the Jag leading in numbers...well so does BMW and the G35.  I was really interested in the x-type whenit came out.  It does look quite beautiful.  Howerver, I test drove not only one but two.  Same opinion.  Both felt like fast wheelbarrows.  I think you would agree that what it comes down to is personal preferance...I just didn't 'feel' right with the x-type.  The BMW I tested I liked quite a bit and it was a tough decision.  I have to be honest and say that it was the 'Quattro' that won me over as well as the excellent lease deal.  My lease on the Audi was much better than that on the x-type as well.  I think that you would also agree that not everyone is going to get a 'perfect car' off the lot (even though we all should).  Every car is going to have its minor (and unfortunately some major) problems.  Fortunately for me (and hopefully you) I have had none.  What concerned me was the article I read from autoweek...""Quality problems bedevil Jaguar's X-Type; two drivetrain issues cited""...Jaguar Cars Ltd. is at risk of alienating its newest group of owners, many of whom complain their new X-Type sedans have an array of irritating quality snafus. While none of the problems directly affect safety or operation, they are of sufficient annoyance that some first-time Jaguar buyers say they're ready to bolt the franchise......There are two separate drivetrain problems. During deceleration from about 70 mph, a high-pitched whine will come from the all-wheel-drive differential unit. That problem is so widespread that Jaguar has issued a technical service bulletin to its U.S. dealers. The fix: adding mass to the differential-mounting bracket. But the cold weather noise is another matter. It occurs anywhere from 20 mph to 70 mph. For some owners it goes away quickly; others have the tuning-fork sound ringing for minutes at a time. This problem has been the most bothersome to owners because Jaguar Cars has not officially acknowledged it exists.

73,"June 28, 2002  1:04PM",eaweg,"Thanks for the response...I too have read all of the magazines...I love automobile literature! At the same time I have come to realize how much biased opinion there is (and maybe payoffs?   )Anyhow, I would agree with you that so far all of the statistics that have come back point to the Jag leading in numbers...well so does BMW and the G35.  I was really interested in the x-type when it came out.  It does look quite beautiful.  However, I test drove not only one but two.  Same opinion.  Both felt like fast wheelbarrows.  I think you would agree that what it comes down to is personal preferance...I just didn't 'feel' right with the x-type.  The BMW I tested I liked quite a bit and it was a tough decision.  I have to be honest and say that it was the 'Quattro' that won me over as well as the excellent lease deal.  My lease on the Audi was much better than that on the x-type as well.  I think that you would also agree that not everyone is going to get a 'perfect car' off the lot (even though we all should).  Every car is going to have its minor (and unfortunately some major) problems.  Fortunately for me (and hopefully you) I have had none.  What concerned me was the article I read from autoweek...""Quality problems bedevil Jaguar's X-Type; two drivetrain issues cited""...Jaguar Cars Ltd. is at risk of alienating its newest group of owners, many of whom complain their new X-Type sedans have an array of irritating quality snafus. While none of the problems directly affect safety or operation, they are of sufficient annoyance that some first-time Jaguar buyers say they're ready to bolt the franchise......There are two separate drivetrain problems. During deceleration from about 70 mph, a high-pitched whine will come from the all-wheel-drive differential unit. That problem is so widespread that Jaguar has issued a technical service bulletin to its U.S. dealers. The fix: adding mass to the differential-mounting bracket. But the cold weather noise is another matter. It occurs anywhere from 20 mph to 70 mph. For some owners it goes away quickly; others have the tuning-fork sound ringing for minutes at a time. This problem has been the most bothersome to owners because Jaguar Cars has not officially acknowledged it exists. Some owners say they have had several prop-shafts replaced under warranty - one American owner says he is on his sixth. Steven Miller, a 41-year-old attorney from Long Beach, N.Y., suffers from both drivetrain problems.

74,"June 28, 2002  4:41PM",cmnott,"Congrats on your A4! Look, no question you were quite gracious about my comments about the A4. I was so disappointed with the new styling because I always wanted the previous A4. So to see how it looks, personally, I hate it. maybe it is just me, but I just couldn't come to grips with it.I found the A4 felt slow reacting whereas the jag had better reflexes. but also felt smaller.  i think it is unfair and untrue to say the ""Ford"" thing, I think that has been addressed, whether people choose to beleive it or not.  The 6 speed was poor, there is no other word for it, but i really did enjoy the automatic (as far as one can).  the jaguar had a much, much better transmission but I was not particularly enamored with the clutch.  the steering, IMO, was better than almost all. I just couldn't justify the price difference when a certain car is TRYING to make an impression in a hot segment.Like i said before, there are no losers in this segment, but I think it is  safe to say none of us would go for the winner of the comparo, eaweg and jagxboytype!"
75,"June 28, 2002  6:39PM",jagboyxtype,"I totally agree that it is all personal preference, and I really believe that most all of the cars in this segment, especially the A4, S60, and X-TYPE, are some of the best.  I don't think there is ""a best"" car here since everyone has different needs and preferences.  They all have their own ups and downs, but I think the benefits of each of these cars certainly outweighs most of their negatives as well.On the X-TYPE article:I read that Autoweek article too, and it scared me a bit before I went to check out the X-TYPE and made me check the competition before going with the car in the end.  Jaguar seems to have solved most all of those problems in the current X-TYPEs though, and the ones being produced now don't have any of those problems.  I also found two articles in my local newspaper that were on early X-TYPE problems.  The initial article was much like the Autoweek one, and the second one came out a pretty long time after the first one; it was a follow-up on how those initially unhappy customers were doing after Jaguar North America finally contacted them and worked on their cars.  They had factory technicians go out and examine the cars and all of that - they even bought back a car and gave the owner a much better new one.  Jaguar was a bit late in contacting them (and I agree that it took too long), but they did get most all of their X-TYPEs fixed and the customers ended up being very pleased with their cars in the end.Yes, some of the very early production X-TYPEs lived up to their old Jaguar reputation for being problematic as the article shows, but the newer ones are much better both in quality and reliability.  Jaguar did many things and worked hard to correct the faults of the early cars, and they even had the Whitley Engineering Center, who designed the driveshafts for the X-TYPE, go through five or six different new designs until they finally got it perfect.I can personally say from experience that the X-TYPE is not in any way a problem car, at least the ones being produced now, especially as my own car has had no problems at all.  It initially had the drippy windshield whiper jets, but the dealership simply tightened a valve on the underside of the hood before giving me the car, and nothing has gone wrong since I've had it.  I really love even just being around the cars as it has been so good.Again, it is all personal preference.  When I sat in the Jag for the first time, it just felt right.  I hadn't even adjusted the seat and it just felt so perfect.  Every time I sit in it, everything is perfect.  The whole car is that way for me, and I bet your Audi is the same for you.And if anyone is paying off the media it's BMW and Infiniti, and it appears that Infiniti is paying the most.  I don't think Jag even has the funds to do that:-) (Although, global sales were just up 62% in April, and they've had record-setting sales for the past four consecutive years now.)And, it is very nice to speak to someone civilized on this board.  Take care of your car!____________________________Blueguydotcom-I actually own my car, we paid the dealer in full when we got it.  The only incentive for the X-TYPE is a pretty good lease price (I just checked yesterday), but even that has been complained about and called false advertising by many as it is only for the 2.5 litre model with no options (not even paint is included in the advertized price for the lease!).  It's also ending in a few months, and then prices will be even higher.  I'd like to see how people complain about it being very expensive when the 2003 prices come out, as they are even higher than this year.  Oh well, it is a Jaguar after all, and a great car on its own.  Option packaging has been reorganized for 2003, however, so getting things like sunroofs is easier."

77,"June 29, 2002 12:48AM",jagboyxtype,"The X-TYPE is Jaguar's fastest selling car right now, it accounts for over half of all Jaguar's sales, and it has boosted Jaguar's global sales by 62% since January 2002; and that number was recorded from April.  In February of 2002, Jaguar's U.S. sales alone were up 105% compared to Feb. 2001, largely because of the X-TYPE.  X-TYPE's sales have been taking off after a slower start since the events of 9-11.Recorded in May, 16,171 X-TYPEs have been sold since January 1, 2002 in the U.S.  Of that number, 2,961 were sold in May.  Jaguar is very happy with its sales.  Also, the X-TYPE is supposed to be lower volume than many of its competators as it is a Jaguar.  Never the less, this compares well with 16,395 Audi A4s and 16,339 Volvo S60s sold so far this year.  The Infiniti G35 has only sold 8,731 units so far, and 11,237 Cadillac CTS's have been sold in 2002 as well."

For those who get the G35, more power to you...so you can beat me in a straight line...if racing was what I wanted I would have gotten a used S4 and modded it to about 340hp...but I really couldn't see myself doing that for at least the next 4 years of my life.  For some reason I have a sneaking suspicion that something negative is going to come out about the G35...I just can't pinpoint it thought.  The '02+ 3 series are just plain ugly with the new facelifts.Cmnott, as for the 6 speed, yeah it was pretty ""odd"" the first couple of months.  I can honestly say though that it has brolen in and that it is worlds better than when I first got it.  To think that the 5spd manual in the 96 Saab 900se that I had before it was actually better!!

80,"July  2, 2002  7:05PM",jagboyxtype,"My point was that the X-TYPE is selling and that there is a larger amount of them on the road right now than there are G35's or CTS's.  Blueguydotcom had asked about its sales numbers and had compared how he had seen few X-TYPEs on the road but many more ""Bimmers, Lexuses, G35s and CTSes"".  I just threw in the other cars' numbers to demonstrate that although he may have seen more of some of the other cars, in actuality, there are more X-TYPEs that what he has seen.Also, Infiniti sold 3,298 G35's in May 2002.  Since its introduction in March, it has sold 8,731 units as recorded in May.  Assuming that around 3,298 units would have been sold in January and February had the car been introduced earlier and had a start in sales numbers for January 1 like the others, it would have sold about 15,327 units (3,298 + 3,298 + 8,731 = 15327)."

There are still IS300 coupe rumors, too.  To a lesser extent, the C-Class coupe takes on the compact 3-Series in Europe.And to top that off, the new Saab 9-3 is a sedan now with a normal trunk.By your thinking: ""You could almost include the Z3 roadster in the mix, as it shares engines, transmissions, and platform parts"", I guess we should include the Camry in the ES300's sales volume since they share those same parts too.

The 325, though, lacks even the most fundamental standard options (no power seats on a $30k+ car!?!?) and has a way to go on the interior design (cheesy exposed cup holders that look like they belong in a Pontiac).  Not to mention the 325 has 30% less power to spin those 4 wheels.The sad thing is that virtually all luxury sports sedan reviews compare a $40k+ loaded 330 with a $33k A4, and the 325 is declared the de facto winner as it rides on the tails of the 330.

I would like to see how it would handle if it were a midsize car (like the Infiniti G35 or Acura TL).The amount of 'points' that are giving to the BMW for it's handling should be removed for it's size.  This is a sedan!  It is not a sports car.  When talking about sedans, sufficient room in the car should be seen as an important factor.I'm sure they could make the BMW even smaller and get even better handling and performance from it.  If they did that, it would be hard to justify it even being in this category."
92,"September 15, 2002  3:18AM",kdshapiro,"rp - you are correct the 330i is a sedan, just like the G35, just like the Acura, just like the Audi and all of the cars that were compared in the latest Edmunds round-up. None of them are sports cars. Edmunds calls them Entry Level Luxury Sport Sedans. The fact is the 530i also gets very high marks in the performance department, except the 530i is a true Luxury Sport Sedan, again not a sports car.Now the 530i outclasses all of the above in terms of amenities, but it would be interesting to see from a strict performance viewpoint, how it compares to the above or even compares to the 330i.Although in the scheme of things size has little to do with performance - as another poster pointed out there are cars the same size as the 330i that are nowhere near it in terms of overall performance. Note the salient word is overall.Also the fact that it is a compact has nothing to do with it's interior room. The G does not have marginally much more room and if you read Edmunds round-up, it does state there is sufficient room in the car for 4 adults in the 330i. Unless you regularly transport 5 people and the two people in the back seat absolutely have to have the reclining seats, in my opinion the amount of extra space in the G doesn't make that much of a difference. It might to you, but then you get to vote with your dollars. If I regularly transported 5 people however, none of the cars in the Edmunds round-up would be on my list.It seems clear to me based on the reviews I've read over the last couple of years, when only talking about the sport of driving in this segment, the 330i is the benchmark."

Its pretty small and the price goes up fast as you add options, and its also underpowered for my taste.I've never driven the C240.

I chose a G35, but if you are a Honda fan or prefer FWD the TL-S is a great choice. It will also run you a little less than a comparably equipped G35, and you can probably get a deeper discount to boot. There have been concerns about the TL-S having tranny failures, but Acuras tend to be very reliable. For direct comparisons of the G35 and TL-S look at the recent Edmunds entry sport lux sedan comparo, the C/D currently on news stands (I have to admit its not very credible to me) and the July 2002 R/T.

Plus, it's a sports-sedan, so the engine is supposed to have a nice little note to it.  Many reviewers have enjoyed the sound the X-TYPE's engine makes.  There is also almost no wind noise as exterior mirrors, etc. were sculpted from windtunnel tests at Pininfarina and high-speed tests on the Nardo bowl in Italy as well as the Nurburgring in Germany.-Clutch: yes, some people dislike its feel, yet others like it because it is not difficult to use.  I believe that it was MotorWeek that stated it felt like a BMW clutch.-Pricing: you can get a base X-TYPE for around $29,000 - $30,000 with leather and wood, manual transmission, metallic paint, etc.  Option packages have been re-organized to allow more individual options to be ordered.  Competators like the MB C-Class sedan start at around $31,000 without leather and wood, but vinyl and plastic.About the only virtue the X-TYPE doesn't have are memory seats.  Beyond those, it's one hellofa car.  I doubt it would still be making up 56.7% of Jaguar's sales and dominating an unheard-of 66% of its market in Europe (especially Italy) if it weren't a great car.______________________________________On the Acura transmission problems, only 16,000 cars have been afficted with the problem over the past two years, according to the posted article.  Accura sells a lot of cars, so it does not seem to be a massive or wide-spread problem.  Hopefully they'll fix it, but I wouldn't worry about it too much."
108,"September 22, 2002  2:57AM",riez,jagboyxtype...  Have you been reading what European Car has been writing?  I'd encourage you to read their articles.  They have a web site.  I didn't write them.  Please don't shoot me.  I just passed along what an interesting source said.  I happen to agree with many of their comments.  Not all.  And I hope Jaguar works aggressively to improve the X-type.
109,"September 22, 2002  3:47AM",jagboyxtype,"""Please don't shoot me.""I wasn't trying to shoot you.  You are just being paranoid.  I never even mentioned you in my whole response except for in the title where I was directing my message to what had been said that you passed along.  I said ""they"" as in the editors of European Car, but if you are now using the ""royal we"" and took what I said as directed towards you, now you know that is not how it was meant.  I will shoot some words at you about improving the X-TYPE, however, as I don't feel the car needs any improving at all except in a very few minor areas, such as memory seats (not that they are really needed, but it would be a nice touch).  Everything that makes a Jag is there in the X-TYPE, and it is a great car on its own.  Naturally, Jaguar will improve the X-TYPE just as it improves all of its cars.  As for your fear of being shot at with words on this board, perhaps you shouldn't say things that would cause you to get shot at if that is a fear of yours.BTW, every month, over 3,000 people just in the U.S. disagree with you and with European Car about the X-TYPE.  Sorry buddy, but you're in the minority on this one.  However, European Car's own final words on their X-TYPE test were:""Pushed to the limit and the X-Type will gently push until you ease off the throttle. Muscled around the track however, and its possible to slide the sedan until the tires melt. Great fun!I came away from the X-Type totally surprised. I expected to find a meek and mild sedan but instead found a serious contender in the sport-sedan market. These first two offerings are great!...I can't wait to see what those rouges at Jag's R division have in store for the X-Type."""

It make perfect sense to have a A3 to battle against the Benz C-230 coupe and the BMW 320i. I saw picture of the A3 and it look ok, right now i'm considering to purchase an A4 3.0, i want to comapre the A4 3.0 and the S3. Audi should ship the lux-golf here!"
111,"September 22, 2002  1:08PM",riez,"jagboyxtype...  Ya gotta stay calm.  Did you notice in your most recent post you did write ""over 3,000 people just in the US disagree with YOU and with European Car about the X-type.""Have you even taken the time to read what European Car has written?  Or what MT and C&D have previously written?  The X-type has gotten mixed reviews at best in America.  Don't believe it has ""won"" a single comparison test.  See R&T's recent 11-car sport sedan comparison.  Think that says a ton when X-type falls short badly in comparison tests.Can you steer me to an American comparison test in which the X-type won?  And what do sales have to do with how truly good a sport sedan is?  I see a lot of people driving Malibu, Taurus, I30, ES300, etc.  To many (most!) people a car is either an appliance or a status symbol.  But it is only the rare few who are truly interested in all around performance.  Some people might argue that low sales are a better indicator.  Most people want cushy ride on interstate, not 0-60 times or slalom results.  The IS300 crowd might wear their low sales as a badge of honor."
112,"September 22, 2002  1:26PM",riez,"jagboyxtype...  Do you read MT or R&T?Check out the November 2001 issue of Motor Trend.  MT pans the X-type 3.0 AUTOMATIC in their 5-car comparison.  In 10 areas of their ""Report Card"", the Jag wins just one, styling.  Has last place or 2nd to last place rating in powertrain, ride, interior design, seat comfort/support, rear-cabin space, trunk useability, and value.  Track results mediocre.  Fourth place 0-60 mph time.  2nd slowest slalom time.  Worst braking result.  They tested a moderately loaded $43,695 one.Check out the July 2002 issue of Road & Track.  R&T pans the X-type 3.0 MANUAL in their 11-car comparison.  X-type comes in 10th overall, 9th in just subjective ratings, and 10th in just performance ratings.  They tested a loaded $46,510 one.Does that mean you disagree with me, European Car, R&T, and MT?  Wonder if you and the other 3,000 people are reading what is out there?  And test driving the X-type against its competitors?"
113,"September 22, 2002  3:10PM",merc1,"Isn't that comparo a little bit much?  I mean how does a ""almost a 1/2 second"" = ""throat raming"" or ""pummelling"" ?   I would expect the Jaguar to be faster with a stick and the Benz with an auto.  I have nothing against the X-Type, but that test is a little thick in my opinion.  One other thing:  Who says the X-Type has the most rigid structure in this class?  I've read that the C320 Sport, 330i and especially the A4 all have very stout structures.  This has also been my experience in driving all three of them. M"
114,"September 22, 2002  9:29PM",riez,"jagboyxtype...  Check out the February 2002 issue of Car and Driver.  7 car comparison.  X-type 3.0 MANUAL came in 5th place.  Woes included lack of overall performance, poor ride quality, poor brakes, and poor skidpad.  X-type was tied for 2nd slowest 0-60 mph time (7.2 seconds), longest braking distance, 2nd worst skidpad result, but did have the 2nd best emergency-lane-change maneuver mph.  C&D's X-type was pretty basic, with only a $39,170 MSRP.  Notice the trend, all the tested X-type's had stickers of $39,000 and up, and most publications harp that the Jag fails to deliver the goods for so many dollars.Pushing $40,000 does NOT seem to be entry-level to me.  The X-type 2.5 is more the entry-level Jaguar."
