    "# Text Analytics Group Assignment2\n",
    "Due: September 25, 2017, by 11:59 p.m. In this assignment you are an analytics consultant to a   (i) brand manager, (ii) product manager and (iii)advertising manager. Your job is    to give advice/insights to these individuals based on the analysis of social media conversations. The detailed tasks are described below. We use cars as an example of a “high involvement” good (recall from class discussions that for high involvement goods, people use social media heavily for awareness building and research).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Develop a   crawler/scraper to fetch messages posted in Edmunds.com discussion forums. The crawler output should be a .csv file with the following columns: date, userid, and message (even though you will only use the messages in your analysis). Before you develop the crawler, carefully study one of the forums on Edmunds.com to understand the html as well as the threading structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Fetch between 5,000 and 10,000 posts about cars from a General topics forum. Do NOT choosea forum dedicated to a   particular brand or model. Instead, you can choose the General & Sedans categories and then select, for example, the Entry Level Luxury forum https://forums.edmunds.com/discussion/2864/general/x/entry-level-luxury-performance-sedansThe idea is    to have multiple brands and models being discussed without one of them being the focal point.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Once you fetch the data, find the top 10 brands from frequency counts. You will need to write a script to count the frequencies. Be sure not to count a mention more than once per post, evenif   it    is mentioned multiple times.Replace modelswith brands so that from now on you have to deal with only brands and not models. You will need another script for this job. This step is meant to help simplify the analysis. A    list of model and brand names (not exhaustive) are provided in a separate file."

Show the brands on a   multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) map (use a Python script for MDS, there are multiple scripts available onthe Internet). "
